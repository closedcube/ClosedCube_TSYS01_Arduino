ClosedCube Arduino Library for
ClosedCube TSYS01 +/-0.1C 24-bit ADC Temperature Sensor Breakout
=================================================================

This is breakout board for [TE CONNECTIVITY (TE) TSYS01](http://www.te.com/usa-en/product-G-NICO-018.html) +/-0.1C 24-bit Digital Temperature Sensor 

---

The TSYS01 provides factory calibrated temperature information that includes a temperature sensing chip and a 24 bit delta-ADC and stored in a sensor PROM.
The digital 24 bit temperature value and the internal factory set calibration values lead to highly accurate temperature information accompanied by high measurement resolution.

The basic working principle is:

 - converting temperature into digital 16/24 bit ADC value
 - providing calibration coefficients
 - providing ADC value and calibration coefficients by I2C interface

**Features:**

 - High Accuracy +/- 0.1C (Temperature: -5C/23F .. +50C/122F)
 - Adjustment of high accuracy temperature range on request
 - Low Current < 12.5 uA (standby < 0.14 uA)
 - I2C fixed address is 0x77
 - Operating temperature range: -40C/-40F .. +125C/257F

**Requirements:**

- ClosedCube I2C Driver (Wrapper) https://github.com/closedcube/ClosedCube_I2C_Arduino
